HINA Inc. is a large FMCG company that is streamlining its marketing budget. This involves taking stock of all its marketing strategies. This, in turn, means re-assessing the effectiveness of its existing spend on various marketing channels. As a marketing data analyst, you need to figure out if spending money on TV advertising campaigns results in a direct increase in sales.  In other words, you need to find out if the TV advertising spend and the sales figures share a linear relationship and how strong that relationship is.

1. You will need to illustrate the relationships using plots.
2. You will need to show the relationships strength using numbers - correlation.
3. You will need to determine if the individual features are statistically significant relative to the Sales by getting the p-values for the features.
4. Discuss the **possibility** of Correlation, Causation or both between the individual features and the Sales.
